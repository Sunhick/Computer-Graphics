I plan to create a Opengl program that will illustrate a street view of a city. 
I will create all required objects myself (no canned glut objects). which means 
all the normals will be calcuated by myself.

The scene will consists of a roads, houses, apartments, trucks, traffic signals,
trees and windmill. I will use textures and lights to all of my objects in the scene 
to make the street view as realistic as possible.

The trucks could be moved around in the street either animation or through user input
(accelerate, brake, turn left or right). I will use sound effects for the truck movements. 
I also plan to do a collision detection so that the truck will not go off the road. 

I will also provide the option of first person navigation in the scene. 

If time permits, I will add navigation of the scene from inside of the truck.

My stretch goals are to have a good visual effect of the truck when it hits an object like
house or traffic light pole so that the truck is either destroyed or disfigured with a sound 
effect.
